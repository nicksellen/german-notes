# Learning German

In the spirit of writing publically more, I'm going to put all my notes about learning German on here. It's very basic for now, as I don't know very much :s

Trying to learn German scares the hell out so be nice and encouraging :)

The problem with it in text form is it doesn't say how to pronounce it, this part is missing. I'm not too keen on those phonetic spelling methods ("vilst doo t trinken") as it's adding a third "language" (some wierd German/English hybrid) into the mix.

## phrases/words

* how do you say <x>: "wie sagt man <x>"
* would like you tea: "willst du tee trinken"
* how do you spell it: "wie schreibt man das?"
* how do you spell <x>: "wie schreibt man <x>?"
* new word: "neues wort"
* my brother and my sister: "mein bruder und meine schwester"

## scenarios

* supermarket checkout
* bakery counter
* sp√§tkauf
* personal contact with someone
